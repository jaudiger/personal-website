I'm Jérémy Audiger, a French guy from the South of France (living in Nîmes). I'm a real passionate in his thirties and an enthusiast about all the things related to science, technology and programming. I'm always looking for new challenges that help me learn and grow.

Since my childhood, I've been fascinated by the world of computer science, and its communities. I never used a Windows computer, don't know why, but I have never been attracted by it. I used Linux as my daily driver for more than a decade, and recently switched to macOS with the introduction of the Apple Silicon. Now things are changing again, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for computers CPU (I see you coming RISC-V).

I was initially working in the embedded world during my early career, and now working in cloud platform systems. I don't like to give my official title. It's a bit verbose, and that's not the title the important thing, it's want you can achieve whatever the circumstances or situations. The hard skills and the soft skills are more important, and those can only be demonstrated over time. So, as I was saying, I'm just a developer than can act on multiple levels and areas of expertise.

I'm eating technology watch for breakfast, and I do it every day, it's like going to the gym for me. I like what I'm doing today, and I'm always 100% involved in it. Of course, I'm also interested by other "normal" things, like walking in my city during morning or evening, taking my bike to go on the road, hiking, or simply reading the news.

PS: Oh, and if you don't know what means "Lore", it's a term used in the gaming industry to refer to the backstory or history of a game.
