All the projects I have worked on during my short life help me to learn a lot of skills.

Below a collapsed list, of course, not an exhaustive list, but rather a selection of the most important ones:

> # [Skills]($block.collapsible(false))
>
>> Programming language:
>> - Rust (one of my favorite language due to its safety embedded directly into the compiler)
>> - Java
>> - Python
>> - C
>> - Bash
>> - Nix
>
>> Back-end development:
>> - Spring Boot (Java)
>> - FastAPI (Python)
>> - OpenTelemetry
>> - MongoDB
>> - Kafka
>> - Redis
>> - ElasticSearch
>> - Vault
>
>> Cloud & DevOps:
>> - SaaS
>> - Kubernetes
>> - AWS
>> - Terraform
>> - ArgoCD
>> - Helm
>> - GitOps
>> - CI / CD
>
>> Low-level development:
>> - Rust no_std (I worked on a personal project, which is not open source, to create a no_std library for AVR microcontrollers)
>> - multi-threading
>> - DTLS / TLS

## Open Source Projects

I attached a strong attention for Open Source Projects. Since my early days in the computer science, I have always been fascinated by these communities which dedicated their time to create and improve software for the benefit of everyone.

### [Brioche]($link.url('https://brioche.dev').new(true))

Brioche is a package manager that is written in Rust, and with recipes that are inspired from Typescript. It is designed to be easy to use, and provides a smooth experience. I'm one of the maintainers of this project with a strong focus on the package management.

### [Nushell]($link.url('https://www.nushell.sh').new(true))

Nushell is my daily shell driver. Since I discovered it, I have been fascinated by the new paradigms it introduces: this shell put the focus on the command output, to parse and interpret it. It's a bit similar to PowerShell. Nushell is a great tool for writing fastly and comprehensibly scripts.

I contributed to the project by implementing most of the HTTP commands that can be later called in the shell or script.

### Miscellaneous

I can't enumerate all the open source projects I have worked on, but here are a few additional ones:

- [Bitnami Charts]($link.url('https://github.com/bitnami/charts').new(true)): I upstreamed a few additional modifications in the charts, since my company wanted to fine-tune a few services deployment.
- [Porter]($link.url('https://porter.sh').new(true)): I worked on it when we wanted in my company to propose a airgap deployment for our PaaS cloud platform.

## Personal Projects

Below, some of my personal projects I developed. And if you want to have a look to my public repositories, you can find them [here]($link.url('https://github.com/jaudiger?tab=repositories').new(true)).

### [Bevy Calculator (Wasm)]($link.url('https://github.com/jaudiger/bevy-calculator/').new(true))

I always wanted to try [Bevy]($link.url('https://bevy.org').new(true)), a Rust game engine, don't ask me why, but sometimes I get these whims. In addition to that, I read that Bevy was compatible with WebAssembly (aka Wasm). Then why not creating something with Bevy + Wasm. And here come the idea of the calculator, since it was perfect to try the Bevy UI system !

If you want to try the calculator, you can find it [here]($link.url('https://bevy-calculator.jaudiger.dev/').new(true)). The calculator is deployed as a static website on Cloudflare Pages.

### No-allocation required communication protocol library

During my spare time, I worked on a communication protocol Rust library that doesn't require any memory allocation (aka no_std mode in Rust). This library is designed to be used in resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or IoT devices. The CPU target was AVR. The code was simulated on QEMU, and a bridge was developed to map the serial port to a local TCP port to do the testing.

This library is not open source, since it was part of an experiment at my job. I wanted to demonstrate to the top management, the usability of Rust in a no-alloc environment. And it was for me, a good fun project to work on.
